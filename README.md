# Google-search-automation-with-the-eye-s-gestures

The technique proposed in this project provides a new dimension to the lives of people who are unable to move their limbs owing to a lack of physical capacities and allows them to use Google search properly using only their eyes.

The work is divided into 3 parts:

-Eyes detection using face landmarks.
-select the desired key from the keyboard by calculating the blinking ratio.
-Send the text to the Google search engine automatically by selecting the "?".
